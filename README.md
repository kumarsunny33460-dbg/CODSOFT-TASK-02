## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of **Task 2** of my internship at **CodSoft**.  
It implements a **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**.  
The AI is unbeatable and ensures either a **win or a draw**.

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Open the provided **Google Colab notebook** (`TicTacToe_AI.ipynb`).  
2. Run all the cells.  
3. Enter your move (**1–9**) when prompted.  
4. The AI will automatically respond with its move.  
5. Continue playing until the game ends.
